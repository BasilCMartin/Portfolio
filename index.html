  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>My career in web development is just beginning. After many years in the service industry, in April of 2022 I commited myself to turning my interest in web development into a career. I enrolled at <strong>Thinkful</strong>, a coding bootcamp, and my journey began anew.</p>
<p>Since enrolling, my passion for web development has only grown. I am thrilled to work with others to build exciting and creative websites, and look forward to each opportunity to grow and learn.</p>
<p>Outside of coding, my main interests are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Music</li>
    <li>Chess</li>
    <li>Cats</li>
  </ul> <p>I have played and performed music my entire life, and have most recently enjoyed playing drums for a jazz band. I also have played chess off and on since I was a kid- feel free to add me on 
<!--LINK HERE!!!!!!! --> <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/basilconnormartin">chess.com </a> if you want to play a game!</p>
<p>I love the patterns of music, chess, and coding, and I dream of synergizing these patterns creatively to make the world a better place, or at least a more enjoyable one!</p>
